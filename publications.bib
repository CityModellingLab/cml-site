Over the past decades, experts have developed spatial analysis models and tools which evaluate how planning and design impact urban residents and the functionality of cities.

  abstract = {Previous studies have described the effects of urban attributes such as the Spatial Openness Index (SOI) on pedestrians' experience. SOI uses 3-dimensional ray casting to quantify the volume of visible space from a single viewpoint. The higher the SOI value, the higher the perceived openness and the lower the perceived density. However, the ray casting simulation on an urban-sized sampling grid is computationally intensive, making this method difficult to use in real-time design tools. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have excellent performance in computer vision in image processing applications. They can be trained to predict the SOI analysis for large urban fabrics in real-time. However, these supervised learning models need a substantial amount of labeled data to train on. For this purpose, we developed a method to generate a large series of height maps and SOI maps of urban fabrics in New York City and encoded them as images using colour information. These height map - SOI analysis image pairs can be used as training data for a CNN to provide rapid, precise visibility simulations on an urban scale.}

  abstract = {Agent based modelling is a modelling paradigm which may transform how key policy decisions are made. Agent Based Models (ABMs) simulate actions and interactions of agents with a view to assessing their effects on the system as a whole. They aim to provide insight into complex behaviour and simulate collective behaviour of agents, often by obeying simple rules, typically in natural systems. Their specific use in transportation and city scale modelling is documented in research but has only recently being looked at for real-world applications and decision-making due to a range of reasons, such as a lack of available data and computational infrastructure. Questions such as ``What are the equity impacts of this transport scheme?'' or ``Will my policy decision have a detrimental impact on those who have to travel?'' or ``How does this decision affect the network outside the traditional peaks?'' are difficult to answer with existing modelling tools. Furthermore, future mobility modes, such as Connected and Autonomous Vehicles, and frameworks, such as Mobility as a Service, pose further challenges to existing modelling tools. ABMs lend themselves well to tackling these questions and scenarios because of the agent level interaction, heuristic decision making, continuous modelling, and the vast socio-demographic data that can sit behind each agent (individual). In late 2018, Arup and TfL engaged in a collaborative effort to explore the development of a proof of concept ABM for London. This was based on previous work Arup carried out for Transport Victoria in Australia, where the team built a city-wide ABM of Melbourne using an open source framework, MATSim and on TfL's work on population synthesis and activity based plan estimation. The joint team developed a synthetic population and built a UK-wide network to simulate travel over 24 hours in London. One of the key objectives of the collaboration was knowledge-share as well as learning. This paper sets out the fundamental principles behind ABMs, their potential application in answering difficult policy questions and the methodology, learnings and outcomes from the Arup/TfL collaboration.},

  abstract = {Traffic congestion across the world has reached chronic levels. Despite many technological disruptions, one of the most fundamental and widely used functions within traffic modelling, the volume delay function, has seen little in the way of change since it was developed in the 1960's. Traditionally macroscopic methods have been employed to relate traffic volume to vehicular journey time. The general nature of these functions enables their ease of use and gives widespread applicability. However, they lack the ability to consider individual road characteristics (i.e. geometry, presence of traffic furniture, road quality and surrounding environment). This research investigates the feasibility to reconstruct the model using two different data sources, namely the traffic speed from Google Maps' Directions Application Programming Interface (API) and traffic volume data from automated traffic counters (ATC). Google's traffic speed data are crowd-sourced from the smartphone Global Positioning System (GPS) of road users, able to reflect real-time, context-specific traffic condition of a road. On the other hand, the ATCs enable the harvesting of the vehicle volume data over equally fine temporal resolutions (hourly or less). By combining them for different road types in London, new context-specific volume-delay functions can be generated. This method shows promise in selected locations with the generation of robust functions. In other locations it highlights the need to better understand other influencing factors, such as the presence of on road parking or weather events.},

Computational advances have enabled for increasingly complex, bottom-up, fine resolution simulations to be carried out over long time horizons at fine spatial and temporal resolution. This has hinted at the possibility of connecting scales of what has been historically been fine resolution operational models and coarse resolution strategic models. The value of any fine resolution dynamic model is limited by the quality of its inputs. The wave of new geospatially connected devices has enabled the harvesting of fine resolution spatial and temporal data on travellers' and even the infrastructure itself. This crowd-sourced data can be used to inform dynamic models with real-world and real-time data, bypassing the need for generalised functions and/or expensive survey data. In this paper, Google Directions API data and Transport for London data feeds are presented in a framework for London. The use of decentralised data structures is also presented and comment is made on the possibilities of using parallel computing advances in Computer Science to scaling up fine resolution scenario testing transportation models and enabling support for a range of agent decision making methodologies. Such data structures offer performance improvements in the storing of dynamic data that may be manipulated in order to simulate local and global hard infrastructure scenarios alone or in tandem with traditional policy or dynamic policy making scenarios.},

This has resulted in a need to better understand behavioural decision making at the micro scale. An analysis was carried out on the London Travel Demand Survey in order to see what behavioural rules could be derived from the survey data. This analysis attempted to relate the financial cost and time cost of a journey to the socio-economic status of a traveller in order to see what relationship existed. Relating this empirical exhibited data to real-world data is challenging. Crowd sourced big-data avenues were explored in order to derive realistic information that considers factors such as traffic congestion, service time tables and the underlying complexity of the London transport network. It was hypothesised that the socio-economic status of the traveller, the distance and the motivation of the journey would impact on traveller decision making. However, no statistically significant results were found. It is concluded that the use of crude small sample size survey data to analyse fine grained crowd-sourced data is inappropriate and highlights a critical need to find other means of recording actual traveller decisions in order to understand the decision making process better. Such insights are critical if better strategic decisions are to be made on transport infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Various route planning algorithms exist today in many location-based services. These algorithms aim to optimize a certain criterion, mostly the shortest path or the shortest travelled time from origin to destination. Urban routes are many times experienced and perceived differently by different users, or even perceived differently by the same user having a different purpose of travel. We argue that each route has unique spatial attributes and characteristics that may have a different influence on the pedestrians' visual perception, where this can be used as a qualitative travel experience criterion to a specific user profile or specific user interest and objective. In this paper, we present a new route planning model, where we consider the user experience thorough visual perception, as an alternative to the default route calculation models that are mostly derived from parameters associated with the road network geometry and topology. The analysis is based on the interpretation of visibility calculations (via the aggregation of line of sights), namely what the pedestrian observes while walking along a path, representing the experiential attribute of the pedestrian. The foundation of this model is the `3DVA' model, enabling disassembling the environment to all predefined visible components, such as building types, landmarks, urban functions, green areas, sky view and more. The frequency and magnitude of the visibility to specific element types, or a combination of visual elements (heterogeneity versus homogeneity) for a specific route, can indicate on a particular spatial experience that is unique to each of the analysed routes, resulting in recommending the route that has the maximum wanted effect on the user experience. Consequently, the route planning model can suggest tailored routes for specific user/pedestrian profiles, augmenting the existing route planning algorithms, and enriching the currently used location-based services.}

To evaluate the correctness, reliability and potential of these applications and services, they are mostly evaluated in terms of optimization or compared to existing authoritative data sources and services. With respect to route planning, criterion optimization is mostly implemented to evaluate the service effectiveness, in terms of, e.g., length, time or visited places. These evaluations are mostly limited in their effectiveness at presenting the complete experience of the route, since they are limited to a predefined criterion and are mostly implemented in two-dimensional space. In this research, we propose a comprehensive evaluation process, in which a tourism walking route is analyzed with respect to three-dimensional visibility that measures the attractiveness of the route relating to the user perception. To present our development, we showcase the use of Flickr, a social media photo-sharing online website that is popular among travelers that share their tourism experiences. We use Flickr photos to generate tourism walking routes and evaluate them in terms of the visible space. We show that the 3D visibility analysis identifies the various visible urban elements in the vicinity of the tourism routes, which are more attractive, scenery and include many tourism attractions. Since urban attractivity is often reflected in the photo-trails of Flickr photographers, we argue that using 3D visibility analysis that measures urban attractiveness and scenery should be considered for the purpose of analysis and evaluation of location-based services.},

Existing assessments are often limited both in their scope and the factors considered. A holistic understanding of GHG impacts must include an assessment of capital GHG emissions, operational energy and maintenance as well as an assessment of ridership mode shift and mode share impacts and the relationship between transit infrastructure and land use.

While existing measures of inequality are mostly focused on income and wealth, it is widely recognised that non-monetary disparities such as in health, education, and housing play a crucial role in creating and reinforcing inequalities. Transport plays a central role in mitigating inequalities by enhancing access to employment, education, and essential services. It is also directly and indirectly related to disparities in housing, neighbourhoods, and health. Policymakers increasingly recognize the potential of transport policies in addressing inequalities; however, the effects of interventions need to be understood beyond the transport sector only and should consider wider impacts. In this review, we concentrate on three interlinked sectors -- housing, land-use, and transportation -- where local governments possess some capacity to influence the processes by which inequalities are created and exacerbated. Currently, empirical research on inequalities within these domains is fragmented. Models and datasets used for scenario testing, planning, and intervention evaluation are often disjointed, sector-focused, and rarely consider distributional effects. Our aim is to critically review the literature across different disciplines and perspectives and propose future interdisciplinary directions towards better measurement and modelling of transport-associated inequalities.},

The demographic makeup of each archetype differs significantly, with disability, socio-economic class, and ethnicity arising as notable significant indicators. This work highlights that an equitable transition to a sustainable transport system requires geographically and demographically specific policies tailored to the unique needs of each archetype.

In comparing the outputs of a tertiary-communities (T-Communities) method and a combined Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) cluster analysis method with an earlier iteration of Strategic Neighbourhoods defined by TfL, indices including neighbourhood size, intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), and the number of community centres are calculated to evaluate their relative performance which demonstrate that both methods create neighbourhood boundaries that can better capture intra-group social homogeneity and are more suitable for analysis than the original SNA boundaries. These results are discussed in the context of the dialectic relationship between neighbourhood outcomes, spatial structures, and social characteristics, leading to more widely relevant conclusions that neighbourhood boundary delineation should combine spatial structure, social attributes, and experimental knowledge to effectively sub-divide urban activity.},

The SOI model employs 3D ray-casting in urban 3D models. To extend this micro-scale analysis to a macro-scale, the SOI model has been updated and is now referred to as the Urban Spatial Openness Index (USOI) model. The developed methodology involves performing perceived density analysis on an urban scale, by deploying a 5x5m analysis grid in open spaces, unoccupied by buildings. The analysis results are presented as heatmaps, visualizing the perceived density of open spaces. The use of the model is demonstrated by analyzing nine diverse urban fabrics, varying in morphology, density, and design traditions in three cities: New York City, Tel Aviv and Zurich. USOI results for different urban morphologies provide insights into the relationships between various morphologies and their respective perceived density of open spaces. This reinforces the understanding of human spatial experience regarding perceived density on a macro scale. The analysis of varying morphologies could potentially contribute to future datasets of visibility and perceived density, serving as a valuable resource for practitioners and researchers.},

  abstract = {Agent-Based Model (ABM) is a promising tool for city-scale traffic simulation to understand the complex behaviour of the entire urban transportation system under different scenarios. In the ABM, traffic is intuitively simulated as movements and interactions between large numbers of agents, each capable of finding the route for an individual traveller or vehicle. This paper presents such an ABM development to reproduce the traffic patterns of the city of San Francisco. The model features a detailed road network and hour-long simulation time step to capture realistic variations in traffic conditions. Agent speed is determined according to a simplified volume-delay macroscopic relationship, which is more efficient than applying microscopic rules (e.g., car following) for evaluating city-scale traffic conditions. Two particular challenges of building such an ABM are addressed in this paper: data availability and computational cost. The key inputs to the ABM are sourced from standard and publicly available datasets, including the travel demand surveys published by local transport authorities and the road network data from the OpenStreetMap. In addition, an efficient priority-queue based Dijkstra algorithm is implemented to overcome the computational bottleneck of agent routing. The ABM is designed to run on High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters, thereby improving the computational speed significantly. Preliminary validation of the ABM is conducted by comparing its results with a published model. Overall, the ABM has been demonstrated to run efficiently and produce reliable results.},
